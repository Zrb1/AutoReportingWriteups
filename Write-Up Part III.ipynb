    "*Note: Sorry about the long period of absence between posts! A healthy mix of life events and laziness has played a part.*\n",
    "\n",
    "As outlined in my previous posts ([Part I](https://dev.to/goyder/automatic-reporting-in-python---part-1-from-planning-to-hello-world-32n1) and [Part II](https://dev.to/goyder/automatic-reporting-in-python---part-2-from-hello-world-to-real-insights-8p3) available on this fine website), the goal of this project is to make an automatic reporting tool.\n",

    "At the [conclusion of the previous tutorial](https://dev.to/goyder/automatic-reporting-in-python---part-2-from-hello-world-to-real-insights-8p3), the reporting tool was actually showing some genuine use! It could accept a number of `.csv` summaries of machine learning summary files and output a single `.html` page that presented the information is a form that was... functional.\n",
    "\n",
    "There three main features that I'd like to add to the tool for now:\n",
    "1. The report looks incredibly dull. Readability counts! We need to improve the *`a e s t h e t i c s`* of the report.\n",
    "2. It's hard to dig into the tables - currently it's just 100 rows presented with no tools to search. Some basic search functionality would be grouse.\n",
    "3. The datasets that we want to run the report with are currently hard-coded into the script. This needs to be split out to make the tool slightly more flexible.\n",

    "How is the CSS file to be integrated our report? There's a few options that are typically at play:\n",
    "* *Download the CSS file and keep it as external file.* The advantage is that we have our `.html` and `.css` files neatly separated, and we have full control over both; the far more significant disadvantage is that now if we want to move our report around, we have to drag a bunch of `.css` files around with it.\n",
    "* *Use a [Content Delivery Network (CDN)](https://www.webopedia.com/TERM/C/CDN.html) copy of the CSS file*. Most frameworks will offer a CDN link  for their file: this is essentially a link to an efficient, readily available copy of the data. The advantage is that you can get a CSS up and going in your page just by dropping a single link in the `<head>` section of your `.html`, no mussin' and fussin' with local files. The disadvantage is that you don't have control of the file, and an internet connection is required.\n",
    "* A slightly more complex option is to have local copies of the CSS file, and then write them *into* the `.html` file. This could probably be done relatively easily and sustainibly if we integrated some templating. The advantage is that we'd have our report in a single file, *and* it wouldn't require an internet connection to use; the disadvantage is that it is going to require a bit more effort to get set up. (This is commonly used approach when creating standalone webpages. Write a [Jupyter Notebook]() to `.html`, inspect the file, and you'll find all the CSS and JavaScript magic packaged up in the `<head>` section.)\n",
    "\n",
    "At this early stage of prototyping, I prefer to use CDNs if possible. The advantage of being able to swap CSS frameworks just by changing a single line of code and not having to bother with local files is worth the cost of not being able to play with and edit the framework. Optimisation (in the form of being able to automatically integrate the CSS into the `.html` file) can come a little later.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start with, I'm going to use [Milligram](https://milligram.io/), a lightweight little framework. To get started using the CDN method, I simply follow the provided instructions to integrate into the CDN.

Certainly, we can explore the option of creating all of this ourselves - there are plenty of examples around, and they're not [terribly difficult](https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_filters.asp). But, if we're being pragmatic (or pressed by business needs!) we can probably find a pre-built package of what we need.\n",

    "After a bit of googling, I came across [DataTables](https://datatables.net/) - this is a plugin for [JQuery](https://jquery.com/), a very common JavaScript framework.

All in all, a promising candidate. \n",

    "\n",
    "Fortunately, it turns out that implementing DataTables is relatively straight forward. From the front page of the [DataTables](https://datatables.net/) site, we can see that the general principles are that we need to:\n",

    "* *Although not spelled out explicitly* - DataTables is a JQuery plugin - so first we need load the Jquery `.js` file.\n",
    "* Load the DataTables `.js` and `.css` files\n",

    "\n",
    "That's all relatively straightforward, with some very solvable wrinkles:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Our tables don't have `id` tags to refer to.\n",
    "2. We need a way to call the DataTables function and point it at the `id` of the table, in a way that fits with our templating system.\n",

If we pass the model name as that argument, the HTML table will be generated with the `id` that we want. The `ModelResults` class already has `model_name` as an attribute, so we can include that:\n",
