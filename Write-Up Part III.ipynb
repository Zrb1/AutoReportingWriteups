    "*Note: Sorry about the long period of absence between posts! A healthy mix of life events and laziness has played a part.*\n",

    "As outlined in my previous posts ([Part I](https://dev.to/goyder/automatic-reporting-in-python---part-1-from-planning-to-hello-world-32n1) and [Part II](https://dev.to/goyder/automatic-reporting-in-python---part-2-from-hello-world-to-real-insights-8p3) available on this fine website), the goal of this project is to make an automatic reporting tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this series of guides, the outcome I'm shooting for is a single HTML page that allows me to interrogate and compare the output of machine learning models.\n",

    "At the [conclusion of the previous tutorial](https://dev.to/goyder/automatic-reporting-in-python---part-2-from-hello-world-to-real-insights-8p3), the reporting tool was actually showing some genuine use! It could accept a number of `.csv` summaries of machine learning summary files and output a single `.html` page that presented the information is a form that was... functional.\n",
    "\n",
    "There three main features that I'd like to add to the tool for now:\n",
    "1. The report looks incredibly dull. Readability counts! We need to improve the *`a e s t h e t i c s`* of the report.\n",
    "2. It's hard to dig into the tables - currently it's just 100 rows presented with no tools to search. Some basic search functionality would be grouse.\n",
    "3. The datasets that we want to run the report with are currently hard-coded into the script. This needs to be split out to make the tool slightly more flexible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without further ado, let's take a crack at improving the aesthetics."

    "The challenge in the context of this tutorial is that this is an *enormous* field that I personally am not actually particularly well-versed in, having only dabbled and hacked in this space.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if this is your first real introduction to CSS, let me take you down the same path I would recommend in learning any new tech:\n",
    "* Do some background reading on the fundamentals of CSS. Hit up [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets). If you're keen, hit up [the CSS standard!](https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/REC-CSS2-20110607/intro.html#html-tutorial). Never be afraid to Google \"simple introduction to [topic].\" \n",
    "* As you read and explore, make note of potential good resources of future information. I would encourage everyone to take a look for an [\"Awesome List\"](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) relevant to your topic - and in case, the Awesome CSS List is [here](https://github.com/awesome-css-group/awesome-css#readme).\n",
    "* With a basic understanding of what the hell is going on under your belt, play around to your heart's content with local files and implement as much as you can in local scratch files. In this case, create small (or large?) HTML pages and figure out how to structure the CSS neatly. I find this really helps to get to know some of the practical realities and challenges of working with the language before I start diving into frameworks."
